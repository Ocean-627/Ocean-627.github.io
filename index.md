## About Me

I am currently a Master student (from fall, 2022) in School of Software, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. [Guiguang Ding](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculty/guiguangding.htm).
<!-- My research interests lie in deep and scientific learning, especially science-inspired model architectures. My research goal is to model this ever-changing and non-stationary world through scientific and interpretable deep models. Besides, I also devote myself to promoting research to valuable real-world applications. -->
